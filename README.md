DEVELOP ArcGIS Toolbox
======================

This toolbox contains script tools for ArcGIS written in Python. The tools automate common processing routines that utilize NASA remotely sensed data.



Installation and Setup
----------------------

To begin, install the following requirements:

 * [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
 * [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
 * [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)
 * [H5py](http://code.google.com/p/h5py/)

*note*: ArcGIS 10 uses Python 2.6 and ArcGIS 10.1 uses Python 2.7 . So choose your installer accordingly.

To use the toolboxes, download the files as a zipped folder. Unzip and navigate to the folder in ArcCatalog. The toolbox should appear and instructions for each tool will be available in the tool's help section.
